## Updates
- Updated OpenClaw 2026.2.9 → 2026.2.15
- Updated npm 11.9.0 → 11.10.0
- Updated all outdated Homebrew packages: gogcli (0.9→0.11), summarize (0.10→0.11.1), ffmpeg, uv, libvpx, libuv, llhttp, pybind11
- Node remains pinned (brew pin node) to protect macOS permissions

## Automated Maintenance Setup
- Discussed update strategy with Sachin — agreed on tiered approach
- Created `maintenance/weekly-updates-playbook.md` with full strategy:
  - Auto-upgrade: Homebrew libraries & infra
  - Report only: skill CLIs, node, openclaw, npm, macOS, casks
- Created cron job `weekly-update-check` — Sunday 6 AM ET, delivers summary via Telegram
- Covers: `brew outdated` (formulas + casks), `npm -g outdated`, `softwareupdate -l`
- Created cron job `daily-openclaw-update-check` — daily 6 AM ET, checks for OpenClaw updates
  - Silent if no update; sends Telegram notification with changelog if update available
  - Sachin approves → I upgrade + restart gateway

## Workspace Reorganization
- Created `reference/` directory for detailed documentation:
  - `reference/setup-history.md` — full chronological setup timeline
  - `reference/macos-permissions.md` — permissions granted, re-granting procedure, lessons
  - `reference/services.md` — architecture/config for all integrations (Memory Search, gog, Bear, Browser, Obsidian, Apple, Telegram, GitHub)
- Slimmed `MEMORY.md` — removed detailed sections, replaced with concise summaries + pointers to reference files
- No changes to `TOOLS.md` — operational notes already correct there
- Goal: MEMORY.md loads fast each session with essentials; reference/ is available for deep lookups
