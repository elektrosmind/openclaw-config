## OpenClaw Config Deep Dive
- Sachin asked for a thorough investigation of all OpenClaw configuration options and settings
- Pulled the full config schema (massive — covers ~30 top-level sections), current config, and docs
- Wrote a comprehensive Bear note titled "OpenClaw Configuration & Settings — Complete Guide" tagged #openclaw #reference
- Bear note used markdown tables which may render with plus signs (+) in Bear's markdown — Sachin flagged this as a formatting issue
- Sachin also requested a second note: a practical summary (not just docs repetition) plus a list of recommendations for our setup
- Multiple "a" and "all ok?" messages suggest webchat may have been unresponsive or lagging — possibly related to the massive schema/config data in context
