## Session Notes
- Sachin asked for a full breakdown of agentic capabilities (sub-agents, browser, computer use, tools, limitations)
- Peekaboo is installed (v3.0.0-beta3) but needs Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions granted in macOS System Settings
- Apple Notes (`memo` CLI) also lacks Automation permission — can't create notes via AppleScript either. Needs granting when Sachin is at the Mac.
- Created Obsidian note "Peekaboo Setup for Elektro.md" with instructions as a workaround
- Sachin is not physically at the Mac mini today — anything requiring passwords or macOS permission dialogs needs to wait
- Sachin's trigger phrase when back: "Set up Peekaboo permissions"

## Permissions Fix (21:36–21:50)
Homebrew upgraded Node.js, changing binary path → macOS invalidated all permissions.

**Fixed everything in ~15 minutes:**
- Sachin granted FDA for node at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/25.6.1/bin/node`
- Automation restored: Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts
- Also confirmed working: Mail, Music, Shortcuts, macOS notifications
- Peekaboo: Screen Recording + Accessibility both granted — full UI automation operational
- Obsidian CLI working with FDA
- Ran `brew pin node` to prevent future auto-upgrades breaking permissions
- Gateway restart needed after granting permissions (macOS caches permission state for running processes)

## Skills Audit (22:00)
Sachin asked which skills aren't fully set up. Full audit results:

**Fully working:** Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, GitHub, Google Workspace (gog), Obsidian, Peekaboo, nano-pdf, Whisper, ffmpeg/video-frames, Weather, Summarize

**Not installed:**
- sag (ElevenLabs TTS) — needs API key + install

**Installed but not configured:**
- Blogwatcher — CLI present, no feeds added
- Bear Notes — grizzly CLI present, Bear app was NOT installed at time of audit

## Bear Notes Setup (22:13–22:16)
- Sachin installed Bear app on the Mac mini
- grizzly CLI already installed, Bear running
- Sachin provided API token `CF72DB-...`, saved to `~/.config/grizzly/token`
- Config at `~/.config/grizzly/config.toml` — token_file + 5s timeout, NO custom callback_url
- **Lesson:** Custom `callback_url` in grizzly config breaks callbacks — grizzly auto-picks a free port
- All operations verified: create, read, search by tag, list tags, append text, trash
- Test note created and trashed successfully
- **Side effect:** Bear's x-callback-url opens Safari tabs at 127.0.0.1:PORT/success when reading data back. Sachin noticed. Mitigation: use `--no-callback` for writes, only use callbacks when reading data is needed.

## Healthcheck & Skill Creator
- Both confirmed fully operational, no setup needed
- Healthcheck: `openclaw security audit --deep` works, 0 critical / 1 warn / 1 info
- OpenClaw update available: npm 2026.2.12 (not applied — user didn't ask)
- Skill Creator: init_skill.py, package_skill.py, quick_validate.py all present and functional

## TODO
- Set up heartbeat tasks (Sachin seemed interested)
- Consider weather, TTS (sag), RSS monitoring (blogwatcher) setup
