## Google Workspace (gog) Setup — COMPLETE ✅
- Created OAuth client secret JSON from Sachin's Google Cloud project (project: elektro-487017)
- Saved credentials to `~/.config/gog/client_secret.json` (600 perms)
- OAuth flow completed in managed browser for elektrosmind@gmail.com
- Services: gmail, calendar, drive, contacts, docs, sheets
- **Key lesson:** macOS Keychain backend hangs without GUI — switched to file-based keyring via `gog auth keyring file`
- Keyring password auto-generated, stored at `~/.config/gog/keyring_pass`
- Must set `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=$(cat ~/.config/gog/keyring_pass)` before running gog commands
- Tested successfully: can read Gmail (found Google welcome email)

## Google Account Browser Login — Not Started Yet
- Plan: also log elektrosmind@gmail.com into the managed browser for general web browsing as "Elektro"
- Do this after gog OAuth is complete

## Memory Search Broken
- Noticed semantic memory search is disabled — no API key for OpenAI/Google/Voyage embedding providers
- Need to configure an embedding provider for memory_search to work

## Notes App Check
- Confirmed Apple Notes working — found the test note from Feb 9 ("Test Note from Elektro")

## Sachin's Google Account for Elektro
- Email: elektrosmind@gmail.com
- Google Cloud project: elektro-487017
- OAuth consent screen: External audience, Testing mode
