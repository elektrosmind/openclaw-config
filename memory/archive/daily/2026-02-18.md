# 2026-02-18 Daily Notes

## OpenClaw Update: 2026.2.15 → 2026.2.17
- Updated at ~07:55 EST with Sachin's approval
- Key new features: 1M context (opt-in), Sonnet 4.6 support, iOS share extension, Telegram inline button styles, Slack streaming, Cron webhooks, Subagents `/subagents spawn`

## Config Changes Made Today

### Model Updates
- Default model changed: Opus 4.6 → **Sonnet 4.6** (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- 1M context enabled for both Sonnet and Opus
- Subagents and imageModel also updated to Sonnet 4.6

### Forward-Compat Lesson (IMPORTANT)
- First attempt to set Sonnet 4.6 as default **failed** with "Unknown model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
- Root cause: I nulled out Sonnet 4.5 from the registry. The forward-compat resolver in OpenClaw needs Sonnet 4.5 as a **template** in the model registry to clone when 4.6 isn't in Anthropic's catalog yet.
- Fix: Keep `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` in the models config (no alias, just as a template), set `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` as primary with alias "sonnet"
- The resolver (`resolveAnthropicSonnet46ForwardCompatModel`) clones 4.5 and sends it to Anthropic as `claude-sonnet-4-6`

### Final Config State
```
Primary model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 (alias: sonnet, context1m: true)
Template: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 (context1m: true, no alias — kept for forward-compat)
Opus: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 (alias: opus, context1m: true)
Kimi: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 (alias: kimi, fallback)
Subagents: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
Image model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

## Observations
- Telegram and dashboard are separate sessions — Sachin confirmed he sees different history in each (expected behavior)
- Sachin tested Telegram messaging this morning for the first time in a while
