# 2026-02-09 — Session Notes

## Browser Setup Complete
- Installed Playwright (full package, v1.58.2) + Chromium for Testing 145 into OpenClaw's node_modules
  - Had to install `playwright` (not just `playwright-core`) at `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw`
  - Required a full gateway restart (`openclaw gateway restart`) — SIGUSR1 hot-reload wasn't enough to pick up new node_modules
- Installed Chrome extension relay: `openclaw browser extension install` → files at `~/.openclaw/browser/chrome-extension`
  - Sachin loaded it as unpacked extension in Chrome
  - Tip: macOS screenshot filenames have narrow no-break space (`\u202f`) before AM/PM — use glob patterns to copy them
  - Tip: hidden folders don't show in Finder "Load unpacked" dialog — use ⌘+Shift+G to navigate to path
- Enabled browser in config: `browser.enabled=true`, `browser.defaultProfile="chrome"`
- Also enabled `commands.restart=true` in config
- Chrome relay tested successfully — was able to screenshot and interact with Apple Store page
- Gateway restart clears relay connections — user needs to re-click extension icon to re-attach tabs

## Capabilities Discussed
- Walked Sachin through all web/browser capabilities (search, fetch, isolated browser, chrome relay)
- Walked through sub-agent/swarm capabilities (sessions_spawn, sessions_list, sessions_send, cron-triggered agents)
- Sachin interested in understanding full capability set
